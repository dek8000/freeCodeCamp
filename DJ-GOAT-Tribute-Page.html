<h2>Who's the Greatest MMA Fighter of All Time?</h2>
<body>In any sport, the Greatest Of All Time is a debate that will always be brought up and can never truly be settled, but that's what makes the discussion so damn fun to have!!!  Considering the realtive youth of the sport of MMA it's not surprising that a few different people could be considered in the runnning for GOAT. They include Georges St. Pierre, Anderson Silva, Jon Jones, and Fedor Emelianko. There may be others but those four along with DJ are the only clear frontrunners at this point.  Of the ones just named only Jon Jones realistically has a chance to continue putting together a body of work that could outshine what Demetrious has accomplished so far, and he's had personal and legal outside the Octagon that have made it even more difficult for him to reach some records, like consecutive title defences.  My real arguement for Demetrious's greatness hinges on his unprecented fluency in every single aspect of MMA, in addition to his ability to mix together those different aspects in such a way that his oppenents have no real path to victory after the first round.  He has argueably the highest fight IQ in the sport and his sense of when he can finish a fight is simply preternatural.  Greatest Of All Time is certainly subjective but I count myself among good company because someone like the powerful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCqlAOXprVg&t=574s" target="_blank"> Joe Rogan</a>, among others, said it before I did.</body>
